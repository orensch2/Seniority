# Seniority

This branch is populated with files running a model of endogenous seniority selection. A computer is needed in order to explore the model, in that payoff matrices of players depend on fixed points computed for the shocks assumed. The script assumes a shock distribution, computes a fixed point for each state of nature, and then gets expected moments for equity, contagion etc.

After reaching a full payoff matrix for each player the script computes Nash equilibrium.
